Step 1) Compile you typescript file using the following line
    tsc .\ts\YourFileName.ts
    
Step 2) Copy all NEW JAVASCRIPT files over to the src folder. DO NOT copy any typescript files to this folder.
Remember, we do not need to add these javascript files to our commits since we have to make these new files every
time we edit a typescript file.

Step 3) Run the following command in powershell and ensure both file names are correct

IF YOU DONT HAVE A DIST FOLDER WITH main.js and 651.js, run "npx webpack" with no other commands.

    npx webpack ./src/YourFileName.js --output-path ./dist --output-filename YourFileName.js

    This command should webpack your files so now in your html you can refer to them as:
    src="dist/YourFileName.js"
